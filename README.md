# Cropquality_Diagnosis
This project aims to classify crop quality using image processing and machine learning techniques. By uploading an image of a crop, the model predicts its quality and assigns it to one of the predefined classes: 90, 70, or 60 (representing quality grades).  The project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate image classification
